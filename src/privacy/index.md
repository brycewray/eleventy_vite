This site and its owner **do NOT** store your personal information **in any way**. However, the site does use certain **externally hosted** services, each of which has its own privacy policies and methods of complying with applicable privacy regulations.

## Notes about external services

### Fathom Analytics

This site uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com), which [does not store your personal data in any way](https://usefathom.com/blog/anonymization). Please refer also to my article, "[Fathom Analytics: count on it](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it)."

### Google Fonts

When I learned that the use of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) *served from* Google will transmit a visitor's apparently **not** anonymized IP address[^Issue1495] to Google, I quit using this product (and suggesting to others that they use it) and, instead, served from my own site any typefaces that aren't part of the so-called "[system fonts stack](/posts/2018/10/web-typography-part-2)."

[^Issue1495]: For the discussion that convinced me to go this route after my initial skepticism about its necessity, see the Google Fonts GitHub issue, "[GDPR compliance](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1495)."

### Twitter

This site *quotes* tweets in the form of purely static text (with, obviously, no tracking involved), rather than embeds of any kind.

## Other considerations

### Embedded videos

I no longer embed YouTube or other sites’ videos, since they can and do transmit personal information through cookies. In the two instances where I formerly did---“[Some curmudgeonish thoughts](/posts/2018/11/some-curmudgeonish-thoughts)” and “[Coherence and COVID-19](/posts/2020/03/coherence-covid-19)”---I replaced them with clearly identified links to their original locations, and footnoted each link with a reference and link to this privacy policy.
